  # Remote state: Cloudflare R2 via the S3-compatible backend
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/advanced-topics/remote-backend/
  #
  # One state per account per layer:
  #
  #   terraform init -reconfigure \
  #     -backend-config="bucket=<state-bucket>" \
  #     -backend-config="key=<account_key>/origin_pulls.tfstate" \
  #     -backend-config="endpoints={s3=\"https://<state-account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com\"}"
  #
  # Credentials come from the environment, NEVER from this file:
  #   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = R2 access key id
  #   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = R2 secret access key
  # Use a bucket-scoped R2 API token with Object Read & Write only.
  #
  # LOCKING: R2 has no DynamoDB equivalent, so two concurrent applies against one
  # state key can corrupt it. `use_lockfile = true` locks using S3 conditional
  # writes, which R2 supports, and is why required_version above is 1.11. The
  # pipeline also serialises per state key. See ../zones/terraform.tf for the full
  # reasoning.
  #
  # THIS LAYER'S STATE HOLDS PRIVATE KEYS. Every client certificate uploaded
  # through var.origin_pull_certificates is recorded with its private key in
  # plain text, because Terraform records what it sent. Each one is an identity
  # the origin is being told to trust, so anyone holding this state - or a saved
  # plan of this layer - can present it and be accepted by that origin as though
  # they were the Cloudflare edge. Treat a leak of either as a compromise of
  # every certificate in it: revoke, upload a replacement, and only then remove
  # the old one from the origin's trust store.
  #
  # Left commented so CI can run `terraform init -backend=false` with no R2
  # dependency. Uncomment for any real deployment.
