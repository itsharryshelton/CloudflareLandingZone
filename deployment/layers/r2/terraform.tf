  # One state per account per layer:
  #
  #   terraform init -reconfigure \
  #     -backend-config="bucket=<state-bucket>" \
  #     -backend-config="key=<account_key>/r2.tfstate" \
  #     -backend-config="endpoints={s3=\"https://<state-account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com\"}"
  #
  # Credentials come from the environment, NEVER from this file:
  #   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = R2 access key id
  #   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = R2 secret access key
  # Use a bucket-scoped R2 API token with Object Read & Write only.
  #
  # The state bucket is itself an R2 bucket, and it should NOT be managed by this
  # layer. A layer that owns its own backing store can propose destroying the
  # thing it is storing state in, and the plan that does so cannot be applied
  # safely in either order. Create the state bucket out of band, once, and leave
  # it out of r2_buckets.
  #
  # LOCKING: R2 has no DynamoDB equivalent, so two concurrent applies against one
  # state key can corrupt it. `use_lockfile = true` locks using S3 conditional
  # writes, which R2 supports, and is why required_version above is 1.11. The
  # pipeline also serialises per state key. See ../zones/terraform.tf for the full
  # reasoning.
