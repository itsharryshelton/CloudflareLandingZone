  # One state per account per layer:
  #
  #   terraform init -reconfigure \
  #     -backend-config="bucket=<state-bucket>" \
  #     -backend-config="key=<account_key>/d1.tfstate" \
  #     -backend-config="endpoints={s3=\"https://<state-account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com\"}"
  #
  # Credentials come from the environment, NEVER from this file:
  #   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = R2 access key id
  #   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = R2 secret access key
  # Use a bucket-scoped R2 API token with Object Read & Write only.
  #
  # LOCKING: R2 has no DynamoDB equivalent, so two concurrent applies against one
  # state key can corrupt it. `use_lockfile = true` locks using S3 conditional
  # writes, which R2 supports, and needs Terraform 1.11 or newer. The pipeline
  # also serialises per state key. See ../zones/terraform.tf for the full
  # reasoning, including why required_version is 1.12.
  #
  # This state holds database names and UUIDs, never rows: the data lives in D1
  # and the schema arrives through migrations/, so neither passes through
  # Terraform. Its own state file is the point of the layer - a workers apply
  # can redeploy every script without a database being anywhere in its plan.
  #
  # Losing this state is recoverable. The next plan finds each declared
  # database by name and adopts it (imports.tf) rather than creating an empty
  # one alongside it.
  #
  # Left commented so CI can run `terraform init -backend=false` with no R2
  # dependency. Uncomment for any real deployment.
